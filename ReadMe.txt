Contribution-triggers and event handling,normalizing,implementing customer management subsystem part
according to the MVC architecture including the UI,data encryption and decryption, writing unit tests

We did this project as a group of 5for database systems module. With this system, a driver can be allocated
to a tour only if he is familiar with the route and if he is available for work. Coaches may be allocated
to a tour if by the end of the tour it does not require a service. There were several other constraints
and we handled them using triggers and events. We use DES-Encryption method to data encryption and
decryption. A SMS system is built for providing billing details to the customer. We used MVC architecture
to design the core system. TestNG was used to create unit tests. We uses Netbeans IDE, Glassfish and
wamp servers.
